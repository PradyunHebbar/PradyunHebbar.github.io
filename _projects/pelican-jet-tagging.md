# PELICAN for Multi-Particle Jet Tagging

A comprehensive study of deep learning-based algorithms for jet flavor tagging at the LHC, focusing on the PELICAN architecture.

## Key Achievements

- Achieved state-of-the-art performance (AUC: 0.961) on ATLAS Top Tag Open Dataset
- Extended PELICAN for multi-particle jet tagging with high accuracy
- Demonstrated model efficiency using only 5% of training data

## Technical Details

The PELICAN architecture was modified to incorporate:
- Spacetime displacement 4-vectors
- Scalar particle identification labels
- Enhanced heavy-flavor jet tagging capabilities
