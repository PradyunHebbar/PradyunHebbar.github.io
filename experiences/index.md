# Research Experience at Max Planck Institute

During my time as a Guest Scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich, I had the opportunity to work on cutting-edge particle physics research. My main project focused on developing deep learning algorithms for jet flavor tagging at the LHC.

## Research Highlights

- Conducted comparative studies of deep learning algorithms
- Achieved state-of-the-art performance in particle classification
- Collaborated with international researchers

## Daily Life in Munich

Beyond the research, living in Munich was an incredible experience. The institute's location near the English Garden provided a perfect setting for both intense research and relaxing breaks. Regular seminars and discussions with fellow researchers created an enriching academic environment.

## Impact on My Career

This experience significantly shaped my approach to physics research and strengthened my resolve to pursue a career in particle physics. The mentorship I received from senior scientists was invaluable.
